# Automated News Summarization Using OpenAI & LangChain

This project automates the **summarization of news articles** using **LangChain** and **OpenAIâ€™s GPT model**. It processes `.docx` news files, extracts key themes in **Chinese**, and generates structured summaries in **English**.

---

## ðŸš€ **Features**
- âœ… Reads `.docx` news articles and processes multiple files in batches.
- âœ… Uses **LangChainâ€™s MapReduceDocumentsChain** to extract key themes in **Chinese** and generate structured **English summaries**.
- âœ… Splits long text into smaller chunks using **CharacterTextSplitter** for better accuracy.
- âœ… Automates text extraction, summarization, and structured output generation.

## ðŸ”¹ **Codes**
- âœ… [summarize_newspaper.py](https://github.com/huiyuy0913/Automated-News-Summarization-Using-OpenAI-LangChain/blob/main/summarize_newspaper.py) automates summarization of news articles stored as .docx files using OpenAIâ€™s GPT model. It reads text from documents, breaks it into smaller chunks, generates summaries in Chinese, translates them into English, and further refines them into a structured five-point summary.
- âœ… [langchain_summarize_newspaper.py](https://github.com/huiyuy0913/Automated-News-Summarization-Using-OpenAI-LangChain/blob/main/langchain_summarize_newspaper.py) automates news summarization from .docx files using LangChain and OpenAIâ€™s GPT model. It extracts key themes in Chinese, then refines them into five structured points in English. The process follows a Map-Reduce approach for efficient text processing.
